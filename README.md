# Algorithms

These are just some simple algorithms and data structures I've written.

`blocking_queue` contains a simple queue implemented with a circular array.
The idea is to make it safe for multi-threaded programs in order to use it
as a message queue.

`fft` contains an implementation of the Tukey-Cooley FFT algorithm in Ruby.
